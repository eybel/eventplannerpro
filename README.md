This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). EventPlanner Pro page was built as a challenge.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

1. npm install or yarn install
2. make sure you have a .env file and provide the data put in .env-sample

3.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This website is a static site but could also be dynamic. That means that it could have pages that are built on demand or cached before every request.

The website uses TailwindCSS which is a CSS framework that I really like to use.

This webapp retrieves HTML code ready to be crawled by google, It can be deploy for free to vercel, which is the official server.

It comes with image optimization which is an amazing feature.
